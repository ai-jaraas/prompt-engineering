### Lab Title: **Ingest, Query, and Visualize Streaming Data with Apache Druid and Apache Kafka**

---

#### **Objective:**
The primary goal of this lab is to guide users through the process of setting up a streaming data pipeline using Apache Kafka and Apache Druid. Participants will learn how to:

1. Set up Kafka to handle streaming data.
2. Produce data into a Kafka topic.
3. Configure Apache Druid to ingest data from Kafka.
4. Query and visualize the ingested data in Druid.

By the end of this lab, users will have a foundational understanding of integrating Kafka and Druid for real-time data ingestion and analysis, making them capable of handling real-world streaming data scenarios.

---

### **Context:**

**Apache Kafka**: Kafka is a distributed event streaming platform capable of handling trillions of events a day. It is often used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. Kafka allows you to publish, subscribe to, store, and process streams of records in real time.

**Apache Druid**: Druid is a high-performance, column-oriented, distributed data store designed for real-time and batch analytics on large datasets. It is ideal for handling streaming data, offering low-latency ingestion, fast queries, and the ability to scale out as needed.

**Streaming Data Pipelines**: Streaming data pipelines are used to collect, process, and analyze data in real-time. Unlike traditional batch processing, where data is collected over a period and then processed, streaming pipelines continuously ingest and analyze data, enabling immediate insights and actions.

**Use Case Example**: Consider an e-commerce platform that tracks user behavior on its website. With a streaming data pipeline, events such as page views, clicks, and purchases can be ingested in real-time, enabling the platform to react instantly to user actions, such as offering discounts, triggering alerts, or updating inventory.

### **Purpose:**

The objective of your response is to guide users through setting up and managing a real-time data pipeline using Apache Kafka and Apache Druid. The lab aims to:

1. **Educate** users on the concepts of streaming data and the role of Kafka and Druid in handling such data.
2. **Provide Practical Experience** by walking through the steps of setting up a Kafka topic, producing data to it, ingesting this data into Druid, and querying the ingested data.
3. **Demonstrate Real-World Applications** by using a hands-on example that simulates a common use case in data-driven industries.

The intended impact on the audience is to empower them with the skills needed to build and manage streaming data pipelines, and to understand the importance of real-time data processing in modern applications.

### **Constraints:**
- **Factual Accuracy**: Ensure that all commands, code examples, and explanations are accurate and aligned with the latest versions of Apache Kafka and Druid.
- **Clarity and Simplicity**: The lab should be written in clear, concise language, suitable for beginners while being informative for more advanced users.
- **Self-Containment**: The lab should provide all necessary instructions, so users do not need to consult external resources (unless for optional further reading).
- **Interactive Elements**: Where possible, encourage users to experiment by tweaking parameters, running different queries, or observing how changes affect the system.

---

### **Examples:**

- **Example 1**: A Kafka producer script that sends JSON-encoded user activity data to a Kafka topic every second. The example should illustrate how to simulate a stream of data and verify that data is being published to Kafka.
  
- **Example 2**: A Druid SQL query that aggregates the number of different actions (e.g., views, clicks, purchases) performed by users in a given time window. This example will help users understand how to leverage Druid’s powerful querying capabilities to extract insights from real-time data.

- **Example 3**: A visualization of the data ingested into Druid, showing trends over time, such as the number of purchases made each hour. This visual example can be used to demonstrate the value of real-time analytics.

---

### **Additional Information:**
- **Troubleshooting Tips**: Include a section at the end of each major step with common issues and their solutions (e.g., connection issues, ingestion errors, or query performance tips).
- **Further Reading**: Provide links to official documentation for Apache Kafka and Apache Druid, as well as any relevant blog posts, case studies, or tutorials for users who want to explore the topics further.

---

### **Clarifications:**
- Encourage users to ask clarifying questions during the lab or in a dedicated discussion forum. This interactivity ensures that users fully understand each concept before moving on to the next step.
